    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This scallop pasta dish is a very simple, easy-to-prep meal that you will most likely be asked 
        to make again! The taste, if carefully prepared and not overcooked, is incredible.
    </p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Pasta</li>
        <li>Garlice and butter</li>
        <li>Scallops</li>
        <li>Lemon juice</li>
        <li>Cream</li>
        <li>Parmesan</li>
        <li>Seasonings</li>
        <li>Herbs</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. 
            Add angel hair pasta and cook, uncovered, for 4 to 5 
            minutes or until al dente; drain.</li>
        <li>While pasta is cooking, melt butter in a large skillet over medium heat. 
            Stir in garlic and cook just until fragrant and softened, about 1 minute.</li> 
        <li>Slice any scallops over 3/4-inch thick in half so they'll cook evenly.</li> 
        <li>Stir scallops, basil, and parsley into the skillet. Cook and gently stir 
            just until scallops feel slightly firm when pressed with a finger, about 2 to 3 minutes.
             Scallops will become tough and chewy if overcooked.</li>
        <li>Reduce heat to low; stir in lemon juice and season with salt and pepper. Pour in cream 
            if you like a thicker sauce and cook just until the sauce begins to simmer.</li> 
        <li>Ladle scallops and sauce over hot pasta and sprinkle Parmesan cheese over top.</li>     
    </ul>
